# Ace-Reg
Event registration application

This code will be used as a base for the newer application. 
Because instead of making the changes, and there will be a lot of them, building an app from scratch would be better. 

# Installation
Simply fork and clone the code then run the app from by building it VS 2013+ 
All the dependencies will probably be downloaded automatically
